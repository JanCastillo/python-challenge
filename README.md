# python-challenge

Since I am not comfortable with using fuctions yet, I made both scripts without using them at all

I would like to find out why I needed to use "with" so many times. Whenever I included more than one loop inside a with it just didn't work.

The PyPoll script is designed to be used for that specific election. This is because I declared specific variables for each candidate once I found out how many different candidates there were. I believe this script meets the objective since a real election has a limited and often small number of candidates.
